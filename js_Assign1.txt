			Java Script Assignments
Assignment 1: 
*Create a simple page that lets users type in some temperature value in the Fahrenheit scale and when the user clicks a “Show results” button, to show the temperature in Celsius scale. For example, if the user types in 32, your results should show “0 degree Celsius.”
Functionality
*At the least, your program should allow for the following
*User Input: One text field where the user will type in the temperature in Fahrenheit
*Input Validation: When the “Show results” button is clicked, your program should check to see if the user has left the text field empty and also if what the user typed is a number and not anything else.
*If there are problems (as in II. above) then your program should show appropriate error messages
*Display results: If there are no errors and user input is valid, then your program should show the results to the user

-->	<html>
	<body>
	<script>
	function fun(){
	var a = document.getElementById("demo").value;
	if(!isNaN(a))
	{
	a = (a-32)*5/9;
	document.write(a);
	document.write("  in Fahrenheit");
	}
	else
	{
	document.write("Please enter a number");
	}
	}
	</script>
	Enter a value:<input type="text" id="demo"><br>
	<input type="submit" value="show results" onclick="fun()">
	</body>
	</html>

Assignment 2:
Write a script which uses a prompt box to get an input. Validate that the input is an Integer between 1 and 30, and then print to the page asterisks (*) to represent the number. Your script must run until you have collected 3 valid inputs as well as generate 3 outputs (one output on one line).
Example:
Input: 4
Input: 6
Input: 12
